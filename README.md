## Pricing and Application of a Commodity-Linked Note

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Most investors own stocks and bonds, but very few hold commodity products in
their investment portfolio. Commodities may benefit from ination. Commodity
linked notes are very different from owning commodity-related stocks or mutual
funds (commodity companies routinely hedge their exposure to commodities).
Commodity-Linked Notes offer investors exposure to the performance of
commodities or commodity indices and provide for the repayment of principal at
maturity. Linked notes are tax-efficient and have access to fully taxable
investments. They enhanced returns within an investment (depending on the type
(Detail/of structured products). Commodity Linked notes reduced volatility (or
risk) within an investment. Ability to earn a positive return in low-yield or flat
equity market environments. This project focused mainly on the approaches to
price commodity-linked notes and to conduct risk-return analysis given physical
measures by applying Monte-Carlo Simulation with MATLAB and optimal
portfolio allocation. To practically and effectively represent the investment
strategy analysis for clients, the project takes also calculation speed, customized
deals for clients under subject beliefs and diversification purposes into
consideration. It helps to get better understanding in putting structured derivatives
theory and quantitative analysis methodology into real world work and
Commodity-linked notes are used and are in part motivated by principal protected
notes that John Hull’s textbook introduces.

**INTRODUCTION**

Structured products create to meet specific needs that cannot be met from the
standardized financial instruments available in the markets. Structured products
can be used as an alternative to a direct investment, as part of the asset allocation
process to reduce risk exposure of a portfolio, or to utilize the current market
trend. In this project, we are going to develop and analyze principal protected
Commodity Linked Notes. In principal protected note if you hold the notes until
maturity, you will receive, at a minimum, your principal amount. In addition, you
also may receive a Supplemental Redemption Amount. However, if you sell the
notes prior to maturity, you may find that the market value of the notes is less than
the principal amount of the notes.
In this paper, we describe the methodology of our pricing models and risk
analysis, and discuss the numerical results of our commodity linked model where
our commodities are copper, aluminum and zinc.
In risk analysis, we are using Monte-Carlo simulation and results from our
risk-neutral Monte-Carlo pricing model to calculate the expected return and
standard deviation that comprise the Sharpe ratio and returns on which we base
our recommendations. We are using the control variate technique to improve the
convergence speed of Monte-Carlo simulation We also include recommendation
for a client who wants to buy the note for diversification purposes.
Lastly, we proposed a business opportunity that combines USD-linked principle
protected note and a market opportunity

**CONCLUSION**
We learn about pricing models and risk analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation
and optimal portfolio allocation. For recommendation for customized deals for
clients under subject beliefs, we compare the mean returns and the Sharpe ratio to
provide the best possible result. We successfully propose a recommendation for a
client who wants to buy the note for diversification purposes.
Lastly, we propose another business opportunity for the client.
